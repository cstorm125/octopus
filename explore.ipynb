    "On July 23, 2020, [Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation](https://www.mhesi.go.th/home/), strictly speaking its committee กรรมการข้าราชการพลเรือนในสถาบันอุดมศึกษา (ก.พ.อ.), announced the 2020 guideline for academic rank acquisition ([หลักเกณฑ์และวิธีการพิจารณาแต่งตั้งบุคคลให้ดำรงตำแหน่งผู้ช่วยศาสตราจารย์ รองศาสตราจารย์ และศาสตราจารย์ พ.ศ. ๒๕๖๓](http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2563/E/147/T_0020.PDF)). The guideline details several ways to achieve the academic ranks including the number of academic publishings and internationally referenced textbooks. One of the ways requires certain number of citations and h-index on [SCOPUS](https://www.scopus.com/) for Associate Professorship and Professorship:\n",
    "\n",
    "###  For science, technology, engineering, medical research, etc.\n",
    "* Associate Professorship \n",
    "    * 10 papers on Q1/Q2 SCOPUS database, 5 of which the author is first or corresponding author\n",
    "    * SCOPUS Lifetime citations of 500, excluding self-citations\n",
    "    * SCOPUS Lifetime h-index of 8 or more\n",
    "    * Principal investigator for at least 5 projects funded from sources outside of the one's own institution\n",
    "* Professorship\n",
    "    * 10 papers on SCOPUS database since becoming an associate professor, all of which the author is first or corresponding author\n",
    "    * SCOPUS Lifetime citations of 1,000, excluding self-citations\n",
    "    * SCOPUS Lifetime h-index of 18 or more\n",
    "    * Principal investigator for at least 10 projects funded from sources outside of the one's own institution\n",

    "* Associate Professorship\n",
    "    * 5 papers on SCOPUS database, 3 of which the author is first or corresponding author\n",
    "    * SCOPUS Lifetime citations of 150, excluding self-citations\n",
    "    * SCOPUS Lifetime h-index of 4 or more\n",
    "    * Principal investigator for at least 5 projects funded from sources outside of the one's own institution\n",
    "* Professorship\n",
